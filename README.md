# Udacity's Sensor Fusion nanodegree project files and notes.

This repository contains the project files, lecture notes and my notes for Udacity's Become a Sensor Fusion Engineer Nanodegree program which I started working on 1 June, 2022.

This repository was created in order to practice to fuse lidar point clouds, radar signatures, and camera images using Kalman Filters to perceive the environment and detect and track vehicles and pedestrians over time.
